# Why am I learning how to do research?
> - Well, first of all, I am currently a master's student in my first year, and I am required to know how to conduct research independently before my first year ends.
> - Secondly, I am naturally fascinated by acquiring new knowledge, so this is a way to help me do it strategically.
> - Lastly, idk, I just have to know this thing.

# What resources am I using to study this?
> Errm... my master's curriculum is one, Elsevier Researcher Academy, and any other resource I find useful along the way.
> tbh, my master's curriculum is just a resource, not a useful one. I did not learn much from that class.

# How is my learning journey organized?
> Good question, I personally did not plan to organize this like any university course will do, I am only learning concepts I think will be necessary, I will get a structure later.
