# searching...?
> - what could that mean in terms of research? - well I think of it very literally; looking for something. in this case, academic literature.
> - idk if there are any more definitions that can be given to this term, but i pretty much think mine does it for me.

# are there various types of searches? if so, what are they?
> - well, there are two main types of search in research, namely; the **basic search** and **advanced search**.
> - **basic search** is basically running a basic keyword search in an academic databases like Scopus, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore.
> - it also involves leveraging boolean operators, using wildcards, editing your search query and refining your search results.
> - advanced search on the other hand, ...[i should come back to this when I get to that part of my studies]

# basic search in detail.
> - so as mentioned, basic search is basically knowing your way around keyword search and manipulating the query to get the desired/relevant results.
> - i would consider an example to help me understand how this is done in Scopus(Elsevier's database).
> - in Scopus, we use `{}` to indicate an exact phrase, while `""` are used to indicate a loose or approximate phrase. for example; {AI Ethics} will yield results  with the exact phrase `AI Ethics`, while "AI Ethics" will yield results with same and/or other ones like `AI compliance`, `AI ethos`, `Ethics of AI`, etc.
> - still in Scopus, wildcards like `*` are used to get the results for the exact word and their corresponding terms. for example; `3D print*` will yield results with `3D print` and `3D printing` in them.
> - boolean operators like `AND`, `OR` and `AND NOT` are popular operators used in searching. for basic search, `AND` and `OR` are the most used.
> - mostly the default search fields(where the keywords are going to look for the information from) are the `title`,  `abstract` `keywords` section of the various literature. this can be modified as necessary depending on what your search goals are. you can select multiple or either of the fields as well.
> - after the first search results(which will likely be a huge number of results because it is a basic search), the process of refining the results can begin. this process will typically involve using the dropdowns, checkboxes and various filters around the search results to enter further preferences. for example; after a basic search of `{AI ethics from government perspective}`, there may be the need to trim this down by the year range, document type(conference paper, journal articles, thesis, etc), subject area, and many other ones you will see on the left pane.
> - after selecting a few other items for the refinement, run the search command again, and repeat this process as many times as necessary for you, until you get your desired results.
> - when you get the final results, you now want to download the results for use in your research to other locations like your reference manager(Mendeley, Zotero, etc.). download privileges are associated with your account tyoes; institution-affiliated accounts may have advanced download privileges to premium literature while regular accounts may only have download access to `open-access` literature.
> - finally, you may want to save your search queries for future use, or help the database use that data to notify you of new developments on those topics. you can find the save search feature on the search screen or use the profile/settings page to do that.
> - that pretty much wraps up basic searching in research.
